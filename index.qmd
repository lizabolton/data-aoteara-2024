::: notes
I currently teach a range of university courses, but all of them touch
on how we explore and visualize data, how we can learn from data, how we
communicate what we find to others (statisticians and non-statisticians
alike) and ethical considerations for people making decisions with data.

I love teaching, and I imagine that as a group there will be quite a
variety when it comes to where everyone is at with their statistical
knowledge and confidence. So please stop me to ask things! If I am
assuming you know something you don't that is a waste of your previous
time --- tell me!

## plan for this session

-   warm-up activity
-   core ideas (samples, population, variance, sampling variation,
    confidence intervals, statistical tests)
-   bogs
-   case studies

::: notes
Statistics is also fundamentally concerned with learning from data and
quantifying uncertainty.

Data Science is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that also
includes the computational aspects of acquiring, managing, and analyzing
data. Both **reasoning** with and **computing** with data play important
roles in these related disciplines.

We've all seen in the last few years alone how rapidly tools and tech
can evolve, but much more than being a series of ever flashier meat
grinders to crank your data through, the most valuable thing about
statistics is as a way of seeing and being in the world. It's a
lifestyle, baby.

With the time we have together, I'm hoping to help you cultivate some of
the big picture ways of thinking like a statistician.

# core ideas

## variability

[**Variance**]{style="background-color:gold;"} or **variability** are
ideas around the spread of our data. We often look at the [standard
deviation]{style="background-color:gold;"}, which is (roughly) the
*average distance of all the data points from the mean of the data*.

> If we each put down how many trillions of dollars we have to the
> nearest trillion? I'm assuming 0, 0, 0, 0, ...

> The distance we've each travelled this week might have quite a lot of
> variance.

## plot some simulated data

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Dot plots of three (simulated) data sets with different variabilities
#| 

# To simulate the same way each time
set.seed(8)

# Simulate some data
data <- tibble(scenario = rep(c("No var", "Low var", "High var"), each = 100), value = c(rep(0, 100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100, sd = 5)))

# Liza's colours
colors <- c("#3C143F", "#87528A", "#808080")

# Plot!
ggplot(data, aes(x = value, group = scenario, 
                 fill = scenario, color = scenario)) +
  geom_dotplot(bins = 20) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +  # Set manual color codes
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~scenario)
```

## summarise the data

```{r}
# Summarise the data
data |> 
  group_by(scenario) |> 
  summarise(sd = round(sd(value), 1), var = round(var(value), 1)) |>
  knitr::kable()
  
```

## sampling variation

**Sampling variation** describes how much an estimate varies from sample
to sample. (The estimate is our best guess at some true value from the
population, also called a parameter.)

> For example, if each of you went out and sampled 20 people and
> calculated their median income and then came back and we all plotted
> our medians, how would they vary?

::: incremental
-   This is much more a teaching thought experiment than something you
    should actually go and do.

-   But we can use what we know about the [size of the
    sample]{style="background-color: gold;"} we can take AND the
    [variability of that sample]{style="background-color: gold;"}, to
    make an educated guess about the variability of the population, and
    so make claims about sampling variability.

-   We quantify this uncertainty with our [standard
    error]{style="background-color:gold;"}.

## an *error* but not a mistake

::: incremental
[Sampling error]{style="background-color:gold;"} is the difference
between the result from your survey and the population.

-   This can also apply to observations of some underlying process.

    -   You have a machine that produces widgets, how many have a fault?
    -   Or, you take a census of all the patients in a doctor's clinic
        (the population of current patients) and they rate their
        experience. Now, you want to make a prediction or inference
        about the average experiences of new patients in the coming
        year...even if everything is exactly the same (impossible, but
        hey) there will still be random noise that we can't account for
        with a statistical model, so we'll have uncertainty about what
        this value should be.

    Alexander](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/01-introduction.html#how-do-our-worlds-become-data)

-   [Mantra: Probably wrong, but hopefully
    close]{style="font-size: 60pt"}
:::

## aside: non-sampling error (actual mistakes)

All sources of error *not* related to sampling.

::: incremental
Examples include:

-   coverage error

-   measurement error

    -   interviewer bias

    -   poor questionnaire design

-   non-response error
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next two ideas are the most "not what you feel like they should be
when you first learn about them" concepts I have ever encountered.

## confidence intervals

> Example: For religious Asian New Zealanders in 2006, the odds of
> mortality in the next 5 years were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.47) times
> higher that for their non-religious counterparts.

::: incremental
-   This is a claim about confidence in the METHOD that produces the
    interval
-   It is *not* the same as saying I'm 95/% sure the real value is in
    here.
-   More like, if in 100 universes I sampled from the
    population/underlying process and applied this method, around 95 of
    those universes I would have captured the true value.

<br>

-   I just don't know which type of universe this is...
-   ... and I'l never know.

This is a finding from my thesis, [*Longitudinal predictors of mortality
inequalities in Aotearoa New
Zealand*](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/67251).
:::

## statistical tests

Statistical tests go hand-in-hand with confidence intervals. They are
really two sides of the same coin.

**CI**: What is a [plausible range]{style="background-color:gold;"} of
values for the thing we want to make a claim about?

**Tests**: Can I [reject the claim]{style="background-color:gold;"} that
the value is this number?

## what is a p-value anyways?

It is NOT how likely we are to be right. It is NOT how likely

-   It is a 'conditional probability'.
-   IF it was true that the value really is *this specific number*, then
    how unusual would it be to get a result like this (or more extreme)

We talk about [hypothesis testing]{style="background-color:gold;"}, and
the idea is that we're setting up a mini court trial against this
hypothesis. It is innocent till proven guilty, so we need to gather
evidence against it.

## common test purposes

-   Is this coin fair? Our hypothesised value could be that it flips
    heads half the tim (0.5).
-   Are the means of these two groups different? We would hypothesise 0,
    as a different of 0 is no difference.
-   Do x and y change together? We would hypothesis that the *slope* is
    0, which is the case where they don't change together.

We usually try to set up the 'nothing going on'/'nothing to see
here'/'status quo'/'boring' value and then knock it down by saying,
well...IF that was true, it would be very unusual to see a value like we
actually saw in our data.

::: notes
Does anyone know what value we usually look for in these tests?

The following is about students in intro stats classes, but I think it
is also really helpful for checking in on your own thinking and
anticipating how others may engage with your communication about data
and models.

# secondary data

More and more of data science, and data journalism, uses some form of
[secondary data]{style="background-color:gold;"}.

Are any of these classical statistical tools relevant?

::: {.incremental}
-   We have more and more scope to measure and observe the world, but
    much of this is through proxies --- not quite the thing we want to
    measure, but something related.

-   I would argue this requires MORE statistical thinking, not less and
    is the kind of thinking that AI won't be able to do well by itself.
