predictors of mortality inequalities in Aotearoa New
Zealand*](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/67251)

<br>

#### consulting

💼 Statistical consultant for a range of business, education and not

<br>

#### teaching statistics and data science

👩🏻‍🏫 Professional Teaching Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the
University of Auckland (2023-)

👩🏻‍🏫 Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream in the Department of Statistical
Sciences at the University of Toronto (2020-2023)

::: notes
I currently teach a range of university courses, but all of them touch
on how we explore and visualize data, how we can learn from data, how we
communicate what we find to others (statisticians and non-statisticians
alike) and ethical considerations for people making decisions with data.

## plan for this session

-   warm-up activity (sampling variation)
-   *errors* but not mistakes
-   testing, testing 1 2 3
-   risky business
-   what i tell my students not to do
-   bogs

::: notes
Statistics is also fundamentally concerned with learning from data and
quantifying uncertainty.

Data Science is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that also
includes the computational aspects of acquiring, managing, and analyzing
data. Both **reasoning** with and **computing** with data play important
roles in these related disciplines.

We've all seen in the last few years alone how rapidly tools and tech
can evolve, but much more than being a series of ever flashier meat
grinders to crank your data through, the most valuable thing about
statistics is as a way of seeing and being in the world. It's a
lifestyle, baby.

With the time we have together, I'm hoping to help you cultivate some of
the big picture ways of thinking like a statistician.

## what will we measure?

If you're looking at these slides later, we probably (tech willing)
decided on a numeric variable to measure about the group here.

## what is a p-value anyways?

::: note
Any D&D players in the room? Baldur's Gate 3 brain rot like me?

What's the chance of getting a natural 20? 1 in 20, which is 5% of the
time.
