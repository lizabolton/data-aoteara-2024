If you're looking at these slides later, we probably (tech willing)
decided on a numeric variable to measure about the group here.

## I have data, why do I need statistics?

Have some hypotheses going in to test o If data is consistent with your
hypotheses, is it consistent with others? - Henry Cooke's recent data
viz on public servants? Might be paywalled (library) - Data moves
concept (Erickson et al. 2019) o Summarising, merging, filtering,
grouping, calculating: While you're likely doing many if not all of
these things already, I always find a clear framework to be extremely
helpful in organising my own thoughts and actions  With secondary data
there is also the need to decipher choices and interpret metadata
(names, units)
