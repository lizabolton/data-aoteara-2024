#### education

üéì PhD in Statistics from the University of Auckland: [*Longitudinal
predictors of mortality inequalities in Aotearoa New
Zealand*](https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/67251)

<br>

self-employed (2013-)

<br>

#### teaching statistics and data science

üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Professional Teaching Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the
University of Auckland (2023-)

üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream in the Department of Statistical
Sciences at the University of Toronto (2020-2023)

::: notes
I currently teach a range of university courses, but all of them touch
on how we explore and visualize data, how we can learn from data, how we
communicate what we find to others (statisticians and non-statisticians
alike) and ethical considerations for people making decisions with data.

I love teaching, and I imagine that as a group there will be quite a
variety when it comes to where everyone is at with their statistical
knowledge and confidence. So please stop me to ask things! If I am
assuming you know something you don't that is a waste of your previous
time --- tell me!

## plan for this session

-   warm-up activity (sampling variation)
-   core terms (samples, population, variance, sampling variation)
-   confidence intervals
-   statistical tests
-   case studies
-   bogs

::: notes
Statistics is also fundamentally concerned with learning from data and
quantifying uncertainty.

Data Science is a relatively new interdisciplinary field that also
includes the computational aspects of acquiring, managing, and analyzing
data. Both **reasoning** with and **computing** with data play important
roles in these related disciplines.

We've all seen in the last few years alone how rapidly tools and tech
can evolve, but much more than being a series of ever flashier meat
grinders to crank your data through, the most valuable thing about
statistics is as a way of seeing and being in the world. It's a
lifestyle, baby.

With the time we have together, I'm hoping to help you cultivate some of
the big picture ways of thinking like a statistician.

If you're looking at these slides later, we probably (tech willing)
decided on a numeric variable to measure about the group here.

# core terms

## variability

[**Variance**]{style="background-color:gold;"} or **variability** are
ideas around the spread of our data. We often look at the [standard
deviation]{style="background-color:gold;"}, which is (roughly) the
*average distance of all the data points from the mean of the data*.

> If we each put down how many trillions of dollars we have to the
> nearest trillion? I'm assuming 0, 0, 0, 0, ...

> The distance we've each travelled this week might have quite a lot of
> variance.

## plot some simulated data

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Dot plots of three (simulated) data sets with different variabilities
#| 

# To simulate the same way each time
set.seed(8)

# Simulate some data
data <- tibble(scenario = rep(c("No var", "Low var", "High var"), each = 100), value = c(rep(0, 100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100, sd = 5)))

# Liza's colours
colors <- c("#3C143F", "#87528A", "#808080")

# Plot!
ggplot(data, aes(x = value, group = scenario, 
                 fill = scenario, color = scenario)) +
  geom_dotplot(bins = 20) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +  # Set manual color codes
  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~scenario)
```

## summarise the data

```{r}
# Summarise the data
data |> 
  group_by(scenario) |> 
  summarise(sd = round(sd(value), 1), var = round(var(value), 1)) |>
  knitr::kable()
  
```

## sampling variation

**Sampling variation** describes how much we would expect a statistic we
are interested in to vary from sample to sample.

> For example, if each of you went out and sampled 20 people and
> calculated their median income and then came back and we all plotted
> our medians, how would they vary?

::: incremental
-   This is much more a teaching thought experiment than something you
    should actually go and do.

-   But we can use what we know about the [size of the
    sample]{style="background-color: gold;"} we can take AND the
    [variability of that sample]{style="background-color: gold;"}, to
    make an educated guess about the variability of the population

## an *error* but not a mistake

::: incremental
[Sampling error]{style="background-color:gold;"} is the difference
between the result from your survey and the population.

-   This can also apply to observations of some underlying process.

    -   You have a machine that produces widgets, how many have a fault?
    -   Or, you take a census of all the patients in a doctor's clinic
        (the population of current patients) and they rate their
        experience. Now, you want to make a prediction or inference
        about the average experiences of new patients in the coming
        year...even if everything is exactly the same (impossible, but
        hey) there will still be random noise that we can't account for
        with a statistical model, so we'll have uncertainty about what
        this value should be.

    Alexander](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/01-introduction.html#how-do-our-worlds-become-data)

-   [Mantra: Probably wrong, but hopefully
    close]{style="font-size: 60pt"}
:::

## aside: non-sampling error (actual mistakes)

All sources of error *not* related to sampling.

::: incremental
Examples include: - coverage error - measurement error - interviewer
bias - poor questionairre design - non-response error
:::

## confidence intervals

# statistical tests

## what is a p-value anyways?

::: note
Any D&D players in the room? Baldur's Gate 3 brain rot like me?

What's the chance of getting a natural 20? 1 in 20, which is 5% of the
time.

# case studies

## risky business

::: {.column width="60%"}
In October 1995 the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines announced people
taking 3rd generation oral contraceptive (OC) pills had double the risk
of blood clots of 2nd generation OCs.
